# Things to install
Under Windows Environment
* Git Bash 
* VS (Visual Studio Code)
  * extention : markdown TOC

----
# History
* I've been looking for the wiki site   
  rather than blog <br>for remembering and sharing what I've learned.

### My standards are like belows.
* English site 
* easy to backup/download my articles

I've chose github and atlassian confluence.

My idea about confluence (cloud)
  
pros | cons
------------ | -------------
user friendly | I felt like it took time to upload

### Finally I've decided to begin github.
There were barriers.
* I was not familiar with wiki grammar (github favored markdown).
* I needed a markdown editor
  * I chose typora and VS at first.
  * Now I decided to select VS.
    * Because I wanted editor to have TOC function (for github favored markdown)
    * Typora supports TOC function not for github as far as I've concerned
* VS : VS recommends some extensions for markdown
  * I've installed **markdown TOC** and I'm happy about TOC.

### Of course, I've installed Git Bash.

### Lastly,
I edited my article on a VS   
Git Bash push command helped me post my work on a github page .
